## ✨ #StrapiPluginWeek

This plugin was initially made as an entry to the <a href="https://lu.ma/strapihacks">Strapi Plugin Week</a> hackathon. Back then it went under the name "URL alias". Since then a lot has changed and the plugin has been renamed to Webtools where the URL alias feature is just a part of it.

See the <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/5409b9415e3e4b66ad27eab967c393d0">demo video</a>.
